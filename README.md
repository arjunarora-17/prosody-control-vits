# Prosody Control VITS: Audio Generation Samples

This repository showcases the performance of our **Prosody-Controlled VITS** model in comparison to the baseline **SOTA VITS** model. Below are various evaluation scenarios with audio samples.

---

## üîà Reference Audios (Original)

These audios serve as reference samples used to guide the prosody of the generated outputs.

| Reference Audio | Audio Sample |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Reference audio 1          | <audio controls src="Final_Audios/ref/1.wav"></audio> |
| Reference audio 1           | <audio controls src="Final_Audios/ref/2.wav"></audio> |
| Reference audio 1          | <audio controls src="Final_Audios/ref/3.wav"></audio> |
| Reference audio 1           | <audio controls src="Final_Audios/ref/4.wav"></audio> |
